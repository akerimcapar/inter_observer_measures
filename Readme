An Interpretable Framework for Inter-Observer Agreement Measurement in TILs Scoring on Histopathologic Breast Images

Breast cancer poses significant global health challenges, emphasizing the need for precise diag-nostic tools. Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) play a crucial role in understanding the immune response to breast cancer. Despite their significance, existing inter-observer variability in TILs scoring methods hampers reliable assessments. This study introduces an innovative and in-terpretable framework to address this challenge. The proposed framework comprises two novel inter-observer agreement measures: Boundary-Weighted Fleissâ€™ Kappa (BWFK) and Dis-tance-Based Cell Agreement Algorithm (DBCAA). These measures offer adaptability for assessing the concordance of artificial intelligence methods with pathologists. Thoroughly validated on a clinical dataset, the framework contributes to standardized, reliable, and interpretable in-ter-observer agreement assessments, addressing the critical need for consistency in breast cancer pathology. The study underscores the potential impact of these measures in advancing histo-pathologic image analysis, fostering consensus in TILs scoring, and ultimately improving breast cancer diagnostics and treatment planning.
